# Lab 2
Your report should contain the following three files:

* A PDF file with the EER diagram (task 1)
* A txt file (or a PDF file) with notes regarding the additional choices and
assumptions you have made when creating your EER diagram
* A PDF file with the Relational Model (task 2)

Place these three files into the gitlab folder.

## Drawing diagrams
This folder contains **XML files** with EER and RM diagrams compatible with [draw.io](https://www.draw.io).

Open the files using [draw.io](https://www.draw.io), make your changes and **export clean final diagrams as PDF files**.

<!-- If downloading it doesn't work to the following: 

1. go to draw.io website, press create new diagram
2. draw your ER diagram using the shapes in the drop-down menu 'Entity relation'
3. name the file ER.xml and save it where you want -->

## Text file
Clearly explain your choices and assumptions in a text file.
